* Implementation of performance counters for Go (based on description [here](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.diagnostics.performancecountertype(v=vs.90).aspx)).
* Context-based Telemetry for Go with handlers.

Please note that this implementation may not be idiomatic for Go and quite frankly completely stupid
but I still felt the urge to hook up telemetry for logical operations with decent performance counters and expvar.

Use at your own risk.
